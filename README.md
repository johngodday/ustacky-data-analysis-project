# Future Work

  - Explore More that one month data to get a picture of previous sales from past years if available, or capture data for the next few   months for analysis.
  - Also i'll love to drill into each branches to understand the impact of specific feature to gross income across each branches

# Standout Section

I went on to access which City | branch had the highest the gross income and also understand which product line dominated. I also check for the impact of Gender and the customer type on the gross income.
Numeric variables like unit price where analyse to see if they are influenzing factors to high gross income in the branches.
